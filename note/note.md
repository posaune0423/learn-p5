## This is my notebook.

Here I'll write anything that I've learnt about p5.js


### Basics

First in p5.js we have 2 functions.

- `setup()`
	- the function called first when the file is loaded.
- `draw()`
	- the function called after `setup()` called

**point :** 
- `setup()` - call once
- `draw()` - call many times (60 times / s)
